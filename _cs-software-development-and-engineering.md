<h2><a name="xaas_t" href="#xaas_c">Everything as a Service</a></h2>

<br>

### Artificial intelligence as a Service (AIaaS)

> Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) is the third party offering of artificial intelligence (AI) outsourcing. AI as a service allows individuals and companies to experiment with AI for various purposes without large initial investment and with lower risk.

### Function as a Service (FaaS)

> FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) is a type of cloud-computing service that allows you to execute code in response to events without the complex infrastructure typically associated with building and launching microservices applications.

FaaS Providers

- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- Google Cloud Functions
- Azure Cloud Functions
- Cloudflare Workers
- Twilio Functions
- Iron.io
- Netlify Functions
- IBM Cloud Functions
- Alibaba Functions
- Oracle Functions

### Software as a service (SaaS)

> Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet—as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.

Top SaaS Companies

- Adobe
- Atlassian
- Freshworks
- Google
- Microsoft
- Salesforce
- SAP
- ServiceNow
- Zoho
- Zoom

### Platform as a service (PaaS)

> Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model where a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools to users over the internet.
>
> PaaS frees developers from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.

PaaS Providers

- Microsoft Azure
- Amazon Web Services
- Google Cloud
- IBM Cloud
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
- Alibaba Cloud

### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

> Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a standardized, highly automated offering in which computing resources owned by a service provider, complemented by storage and networking capabilities, are offered to customers on demand. Resources are scalable and elastic in near real time and metered by use. 

IaaS Providers

- Alibaba Elastic Compute Service
- Amazon EC2
- Azure Virtual Machines
- DigitalOcean Droplets
- Google Compute Engine
- IBM Cloud Private
- Linode
- Synology Virtual Machine Manager
