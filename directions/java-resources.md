### Web Services

#### Microservices

> Microservices are more than writing the code.
>
> Microservices are more than the business logic. You need to think about the environment where you’ll run the services and how the services will scale and be resilient.
>
> Microservices are nothing but an extension of RESTful web services with the main objective being to break up your code into small, distributed, and independent services for better management.

    <summary>理解微服务 Click to expand!</summary>

1. 什么是微服务

简单理解：内存里的函数调用 => 网络接口调用。按模块分割后，交给不同部门各自更新维护，减少代码冲突和升级失败的地图炮。小项目上微服务有反作用。所有微服务组件都是围绕这件事展开的。

最关键的是服务本体 RPC 和为了方便大家调用和发布 RPC 的服务发现。然后就是为了保障服务质量的熔断，监控，多 DC 部署等。

微服务说到底只是一种思想，关键在与服务怎么规划和拆分。自己设计好服务的拆分，用 REST API，每个服务怎么管理也相对独立。

总体思路把控到，然后看看相应的实现组件就行了。1）业务分拆为独立的服务。2）业务之间的交互（服务之间的交互）。3）为了网络容错、发现、追踪问题而扩展的其他东西（异常监控、调用链、预警、熔断之类的，所谓服务治理）。

没用微服务，可能只是性能问题，堆硬件就可以了。用上微服务，怎么熔断，怎么监控，怎么发现，怎么容错，怎么通信...

没具体需求，你很难学会的。微服务体系说简单点就是为了解决远程调用这一个需求衍生出来的。你首先得有需要远程调用不可的业务，然后业务量大了，你就算不懂“微服务”这个词，最终你为了满足需求，还是会搞定一整套体系。

不是你不懂，是你没有场景。

微服务更多的开发和架构经验上升华，同时面对微服务带来的变化，必须对公司的组织架构和运维全方面改造升级。

2. 为什么要用微服务

系统架构本质是组织架构的表现。Conway's law (康威定律)：团队结构设计的系统将不可避免地产生与团队沟通结构相一致的设计。

微服务的两个最大的意义：独立发布和独立伸缩。

微服务更像是「鸡蛋不放一个篮子里」，各种服务不会一起挂，局部服务挂了直接熔断降级，不影响其他 p0 服务正常就行；但是单体应用就会受木桶理论影响，一堆的服务要为某一个短板服务买单。

遇到一个很实在的问题，系统有两大核心接口，有一个接口耗时长，有一个耗时短。如果耗时长的接口占用了 io 线程，另一个耗时短的接口就没法处理，这时候应该把耗时长的单独部署出来。

微服务确实浪费计算机资源，但是可以分散团队各自独立开发微服务。

为什么说单体有并发问题？单体服务，又不是只部署一台服务器（可以负载均衡部署多套）🤣🤣🤣如果业务不是特别复杂，单体没啥问题，有性能问题，升级服务器就行。

单体最大的问题是单点故障，能接受就用单体。

微服务是一种拆分的思想。当业务和项目规模扩大之后，为了在某些高压力的模块上能够做到水平扩展，自然会将这个模块拆成无状态的子服务，随之就会引入 mq 等中间件用来同步状态和通信。为了能够降低服务间调用和配置管理的负担，就会引入了配置中心和注册中心。微服务化是一种循序渐进的过程，上来就全盘微服务，成本太高了。楼上说的单体项目集群部署，不也是微服务的思想吗。所以项目刚开发的时候应该做好模块分割，模块间通信尽量做成事件机制，为以后可能的微服务改造打好基础。

用单体还是用微服务是看团队人数的多少决定的。  
1.你们几千个人了，肯定是按职能，各个团队开发自己的服务。微服务还是挺好用的。  
2.如果你们只有几个人，那还是单体吧。微服务没必要。

看你业务，组织架构是怎么样的吧。一般小公司确实不需要微服务，微服务和崩溃没必然联系，单体也是可以多机部署的。

组织即架构。  
如果公司技术团队几个人，那么单体服务是比较合适的；如果达到 10 人，那么建议拆成两三个服务。
基本上每三个人维护一个服务是比较合适的。

不要迷信微服务，现在 Java 的性能不弱，而且做水平扩展和负载均衡，跟微服务也无关。而且单体服务的性能一定是要强于微服务的，方法调用和远程调用哪个更快？
微服务的诞生和敏捷开发的模式有很强的相关性，各个团队的服务在开发层面互不干扰，至少不会天天去解冲突。但如果就你们一波人在做，核心业务也只有一个，那完全没必要为了微服务而微服务。
